Github is great! It takes a little practice to work with moving things backwards and forwards between the command line and github but a little trial and error solves most things. I think I might feel more comfortable with some of the more complex uses like branching and merging with more practice when working in groups. Github really is great though as a place to track commits, merge changes and collaborate with others. I could make more use of mv for moving files. Sometimes I switch to finder for moving folders/files. 

When starting a project it can take a second to decide whether to start it locally or begin with Github. Not sure it matters too much but beginning with github is easy enough. I noticed one thing about beginning a project on Github. The difference between starting a repository with a README.md file or not. 

Initialized with a README.md file:

And without:

The detailed command line instructions are most useful. Creating a README.md locally is a fast way to sync to Github. It seems like such a simple decision but it you don't think through beginning a project you can run into some conflicting or confusing information online for something that should be straightforward.
