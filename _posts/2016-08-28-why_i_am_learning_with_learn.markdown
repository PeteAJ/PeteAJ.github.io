# Why I am Learning with Learn. Why am I interested in learning software development? This is a great question! I have done some HTML/CSS in the past and work with javascript (specifically Processing) for fun and art and a way to keep the mind active. This is my [http://www.openprocessing.org/user/13587] on Open Processing which is a site for displaying and sharing Processing pieces and code.

I would like to work in software development and build upon what I have already learned about code for practical applications on the web and for finding fulfilling work outlets as well. I am also interested in learning Swift and making apps. I recently attended a science fair at the Flatiron School where I got to see the final projects of current students. I really enjoyed seeing the work coming out of the web and mobile classes. It was great to see students where preparing to pursue App Store approval for the work and get what they have done out into the world. That seems like a great goal for software development generally: creating things people can use in browsers or on their phones that might be useful or fun or show new ways of interaction.
